About me
======

I am currently a junior computer science student at the [University of Louisiana Monroe](https://www.ulm.edu/cbss/computerscience/program/) and on track to graduate May of 2026. 

I appreciate the logical and analytical aspects of computer science and computer programming. I also see it as a canvas for creativity. It's an art form where every line and function contributes to something greater than me.


## Experience

### Old Dominion University 

Research Intern ~ Summer 2023

__[MDPI Article](https://www.mdpi.com/2313-433X/9/11/239)__

During my research internship at [Old Dominion University](https://www.odu.edu/academics/research-experiences/reu/cis), I had the privilege of contributing to an innovative project focused on enhancing the online experience for screen reader users. Under the guidance of [Dr. Ashok](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Of8dNP0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and in collaboration with [Satwik Kodandaram](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pPFFz6AAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), I played a crucial role in the research and development of a comprehensive browser extension designed to protect screen reader users from deceptive online content. 

Key Responsibilities and Contributions:

* Familiarizing Myself with Prior Work: I began my internship by thoroughly reviewing existing literature and research related to screen reader user experiences and deceptive online content. This helped me gain a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities in this field.

* Data Collection and Cleaning: One of my primary responsibilities was to collect a diverse and representative dataset of online advertisements. I cleaned and preprocessed this dataset to ensure its accuracy and reliability for subsequent analysis.

* Model Training: Working closely with Dr. Ashok and Satwik, I actively participated in the training of a large language model. BERT was used for ad text and Vision Transformer was used for the ad image. This model was specifically tailored to accurately distinguish between deceptive and non-deceptive online advertisements. This involved fine-tuning the model using the carefully curated dataset to improve its performance.


### University of Louisiana Monroe

Emerging Scholar ~ Spring 2023 - Current

__[Github Repo](https://github.com/Parker-Story/TestBankGenerator)__

Via the Emerging Scholars Program I have had the privilege to work with ULM's former program coordinator of Computer Science, [Dr. Cordova](https://webservices.ulm.edu/facultyactivities/profile/cordova), on this fascinating project that has some very exciting ideas for application within the university. Starting Spring 2023, our goal was to write a program for each Discrete Structures question type that could recieve data from a file and then use that data to generate a large amount of unique questions for that respective type. The wider scope of the project is to collect data and determine if each student getting their own unique question encourages cooperation and group studying, thus improving overall study time and scores in the course.

By the end of the Semester, we began using the software to generate questions for in class activities, homework, quizzes, and tests. 

Before any data was able to be collected, Dr. Cordova and I were informed that the University will be switching to the LMS Canvas so the primary focus for the Fall 2023 semester and onward is to convert the existing software so that it functions within the new LMS.

* Develop a collection of software capable of generating a collection of advanced discrete 
mathematical structures exercises.

* Utilize in a study on the effects of randomness of exercise selection in student assignments.

* Generate flexible software capable of generating large collections of exercises in an electronic 
format that can be imported by common learning management systems.

## Projects

Floyd's Shortest Distance-Path Algorithm 

__[Github Repo](https://github.com/Parker-Story/Floyds-Shortest-Distance-Path)__

* Developed a Java application implementing the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to compute the shortest 
distances and paths between vertices in a graph.

* Utilized an adjacency matrix for input representation, handling vertices with self-travel, unexplored 
paths, and specific path computations.

* Generates and outputs a distance matrix and a path matrix to display the shortest distances and 
paths between vertices
