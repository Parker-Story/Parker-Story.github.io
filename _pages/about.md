About me
======

I am currently a sophmore computer science student at [University of Louisiana Monroe](https://www.ulm.edu/cbss/computerscience/program/) and on track to graduate May of 2026. 

I appreciate the logical and analytical aspects of computer science. I also see it as a canvas for creativity. I believe that a programmer, like a painter or a poet, is a maker of patterns. It's an art form where every line and function contributes to something greater than me.

# Experience

### Old Dominion University 
  #### Research Intern - Summer 2022

During my research internship at Old Dominion University, I had the privilege of contributing to an innovative project focused on enhancing the online experience for screen reader users. Under the guidance of Dr. Ashok and in collaboration with Satwik Kodandaram, I played a crucial role in the research and development of a comprehensive browser extension designed to protect screen reader users from deceptive online content.

Key Responsibilities and Contributions:

* Familiarizing Myself with Prior Work: I began my internship by thoroughly reviewing existing literature and research related to screen reader user experiences and deceptive online content. This helped me gain a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities in this field.

* Data Collection and Cleaning: One of my primary responsibilities was to collect a diverse and representative dataset of online advertisements. I cleaned and preprocessed this dataset to ensure its accuracy and reliability for subsequent analysis.

* Model Training: Working closely with Dr. Ashok and Satwik, I actively participated in the training of a large language model. BERT was used for ad text and Vision Transformer was used for the ad image. This model was specifically tailored to accurately distinguish between deceptive and non-deceptive online advertisements. This involved fine-tuning the model using the carefully curated dataset to improve its performance.

# Projects

- ### Massive Test Bank Generation 

__[Massive Test Bank Generation Github Repo](github.link.com)__

Via the Emerging Scholars Program I have had the privlage to work with Dr. Cordova on this facinating project that has some very exciting ideas for application within the university. Starting Spring 2022, our goal was to write a program for each Discrete Structures question type that could recieve data from a file and then use that data to instantly generate an unlimited amount of unique questions for that respective type. The wider scope of the project is to collect data and determine if each student getting their own unique question encourages cooperation and group studying, thus improving overall study time and grades in the course.

By the end of the Semester, we successfully implemented 30 question types and began using the software to generate questions for in class activities, homework, quizzes, and tests. 

Before any data was able to be collected, Dr. Cordova and I were informed that the University will be switching to the LMS Canvas so the primary focus for the Fall 2022 semester will be converting the existing software so that it functions within the new LMS.
