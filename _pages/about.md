About me
======

I am currently a sophmore computer science student at [University of Louisiana Monroe](https://www.ulm.edu/cbss/computerscience/program/) and on track to graduate in May of 2026. 

I appreciate the logical and analytical aspects of computer science. I also see it as a canvas for creativity. I believe that a programmer, like a painter or a poet, is a maker of patterns. It's an art form where every line and function contributes to something greater than me.

### Massive Test Bank Generation

Via the Emerging Scholars Program I have had the privlage to work with Dr. Cordova on this facinating project that has some very exciting ideas for application within the university. Starting Spring 2022, our goal was to write a program for each Discrete Structures question type that could recieve data from a file and then use that data to instantly generate an unlimited amount of unique questions for that respective type. The wider scope of the project is to collect data and determine if each student getting their own unique question encourages cooperation and group studying, thus improving overall study time and grades in the course.

By the end of the Semester, we successfully implemented 30 question types and began using the software to generate questions for in class activities, homework, quizzes, and tests. 

Before any data was able to be collected, Dr. Cordova and I were informed that the University will be switching to the LMS Canvas so the primary focus for the Fall 2022 semester will be converting the existing software so that it functions within the new LMS.
